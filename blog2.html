        <h1>Blog Post 2</h1>
        <p>This week's experience for me can actually be summed up in one word: Yuck.</p>
        <p>However, for the sake of providing myself (and any others who might care about my journey) with something remotely substantive to read later on, I'll expound (a little) further.</p>
        <p>The intro to JavaScript Arrays was a crushing blow to my ego. Like a Tyson-in-his-prime blow. I was feeling pretty good about myself after our walk through last week's material, only for my confidence to plummet face-down into the concrete when the array exercises were given.</p>
        <p>Don't get me wrong: the overall concepts were presented well, and I felt like I understood them. And I didn't expect to completely master the exercises on the first bite. I can handle trying something and getting it wrong. You figure out the misstep, make a tweak and go on. But my frustration came in because I didn't feel like I knew how <em>to even begin</em> to approach the exercises. I just felt completely and utterly lost.</p>
        <p>Then came the discussion on objects and functions. Again, I felt like I understood the lecture, but then felt pretty lost in approaching the exercises. I realized that one struggle I was having was with how much html coding could be done with JavaScript. We did one exercise that involved using if else statements to assign classes to objects and creating CSS rules based on those classes. It literally blew the top off my head because I was assuming it would be harder - or rather, involve more coding in the html file - than was necessary, since linking to a stylesheet was involved.</p>
        <p>Add to all this: our group has trouble "grouping" at times. Fortunately, I don't think that the reason has anything to do with competitiveness. It just seems like we have a group full of introverts, and maybe the ones who understand a little more aren't sure how to help without feeling like they may just be giving away the answer; so we end up all just kind of working (or crying) in silence sometimes. Silver lining: we seem to be getting better though. Our Slack conversation today has been more active. So I'm glad about that.</p>
        <p>And mysteriously, somewhere between contemplating my life choices in the shower Saturday night and today (Sunday night), a little of the fog has lifted it seems. I really don't even know how. Like I actually got through 4 of the 5 object challenges and I've completed 3 of the 5 function challenges so far. With minimal help even! I still have a couple questions and need to revisit some of the array challenges I didn't finish, but I might actually be understanding a little something again! So hooray for me being off suicide watch!</p>
