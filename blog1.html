        <h1>Blog Post 1</h1>
        <p>I must admit that I wasn't too thrilled upon first hearing that we would be blogging about our NSS journey weekly. I thought, "Great. Yet <em>another</em> thing to add to my already full plate." But now, a few class meetings in, I think it's not such a bad idea. With all that I feel I'm learning already, it should be quite interesting to get to the end of the program, look back and read all the mile markers along the way.</p>
        <p>The first thing that I've learned... or maybe that's been reinforced... is that I can always begin again or try something new. I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity to do so through this program. My initial anxiety about having been out of school for such a long time has been quelled by the kindness and reassurance of patient instructors... not to mention a great, hands-on program featuring instruction on concepts that are immediately usable in the real world.</p>
        <p>As far as course content is concerned, I'm not really sure what I learned first. It appears that my confidence takes a while to catch up with my knowlegde. So I learn things before I'm really confident that I know them, if that makes any sense at all.</p>
        <p>Our first couple class meetings were spent on HTML and CSS, much of which was review since the pre-work covered both subjects in detail. I did learn about the abbreviation tag, which was unknown to me before. I also learned that boilerplate code, containing tags for document type, head, body, title, and stylesheet links, is the minimum required code to create a web page. One major thing that I learned in our time spent on CSS is that specificity rules: the more specific the selector, the higher its priority in styling where conflicts may arise.</p>
        <p>The terminal, git and Github, although covered by Treehouse courses in the pre-work, started off feeling rather foreign to me. It has been ages since I've dealt with the terminal or typing in the command line; so the thought of going back to it was pretty intimidating. However, so far I've learned about directories and how to navigate between them using the terminal instead of the finder. Still rusty on a few commands/actions, especially when it comes to moving files, but I'm getting there. I've learned about repositories - both local and origin - and I'm growing more comfortable with the process of pushing to and pulling from Github. I've learned about the concept of branching and why it's useful when collaborating with others on group projects. It looks like we're starting to put that knowledge to use with our first group assignment; so I'm looking forward to the confidence boost once it's completed.</p>
